h2. Contributions

Gemcutter has a 'commit-bit' policy, much like the Rubinius project. So we do too. Submit a patch that is accepted, and you can get full commit access to the project. All you have to do is ask us on #javagems on Freenode or bug gabrielg or jaknowlden in a message and they'll add you as a collaborator on the main repository. Feel free to fork the project though and have fun in your own sandbox.

Please read up on the "GitHub Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/thumblemonks/javagems-gemcutter/contribution-guidelines for the latest contribution guidelines.

h2. Organization

Gemcutter consists of a few major parts:

* Rails app: To manage users and allow others to view gems, etc.
* Sinatra app (Hostess): the gem server, lives in @app/metal/hostess.rb@.
* RubyGem: The gemcutter client gem that interacts with the site, lives in @gem/@.
* Gem processor: Handles incoming gems and storing them in S3 (production) or on the filesystem in @server/@ (development). Lives in @lib/gemcutter.rb@, @lib/indexer.rb@, @lib/vault.rb@.

h2. License

Gemcutter uses the MIT license. Please check the LICENSE file for more details.
