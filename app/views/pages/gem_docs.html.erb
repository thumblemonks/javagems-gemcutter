<p>
For gem publishers, you'll want to install the gemcutter gem to get started: <code>gem install gemcutter</code> Once the gem is installed, several new <code>gem</code> commands are available to you, and they are explained in detail below.
</p>
<p>
The JavaGems gem requires at least RubyGems 1.3.3 in order to work. Please upgrade by running <code>gem update --system</code> if you haven't already!
</p>

<h4 id="push">javagem push</h4>
<p>
Publish your gems to the world with one command. All that's required is your very own JavaGems account. The first time you push, you'll be asked to log in, and then JavaGems will save your API key to <code>~/.javagemrc</code>. Once your gem is pushed, it is processed, indexed, and uploaded to Amazon S3 behind the scenes and should be available for download within moments.
<pre><code>$ javagem push pkg/gemcutter-0.1.3.gem
